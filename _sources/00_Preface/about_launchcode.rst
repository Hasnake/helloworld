About LaunchCode
::::::::::::::::

From `launchcode.org/about`_:

    LaunchCode is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating economic opportunity for aspiring developers through job placement and training in technology.


    Through our program, we aim to solve two problems:


    First, millions of Americans are unemployed, and many more are stuck in low-wage job cycles which leave them struggling to find jobs that offer livable salaries, employable skills, and a chance for advancement.


    American businesses also have a problem —there just isn’t enough tech talent to match the growing demand. The US Department of Labor predicts this situation will only worsen, leaving 1 million programming jobs unfilled by 2020.


    Back in 2013, Square’s Jim McKelvey cofounded LaunchCode to address these problems. Jim experienced the lack of talent firsthand while trying to get Square started in his hometown of St. Louis, MO. Eventually Jim moved Square to California, but knew there must be some way to connect the city’s rising unemployment with its shortage of tech talent.


    LaunchCode was founded in 2013 to help companies find skilled, new tech talent — from all backgrounds and walks of life.
