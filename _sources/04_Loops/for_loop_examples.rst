For loop examples
:::::::::::::::::

Let's get familiar with for loops by looking at several examples.

.. note::

    We'll continue to use the term "for loop" instead of just "loop" because there are other types of loops. We won't explore them in this class, but we still want to get used to the correct terminology.

    **Party Time!**
    Let’s say we have some friends, and we’d like to send
    them each an email inviting them to our party. We don’t quite know how to
    send email yet, so for the moment we’ll just print a message for each friend.


    .. activecode:: ex_4_1

        #TODO 1: Finish creating a list of names. Each should be a separate string.
        friends = ["Elvis", ]
        #TODO 2: Create a for loop using that list
        #TODO 3: Inside the loop, print out a short invitation to the person using their name.
