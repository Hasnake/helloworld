        **Book Reviews**
        We are going to build a "Siri" that asks users for a book title, then gives the user its opinion on that book. However our Siri changes its mind a lot - so it initially responds positively, then changes its mind. See the example below.

        .. sourcecode:: python

            > What's your favorite book? Curious George
            > I love Curious George!
            > ...actually, Curious George is kind of meh. You need a better taste in books!

        .. activecode:: ex_2_2

            # TODO - prompt the user for their favorite book

            # TODO - give conflicting opinions
