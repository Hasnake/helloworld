What Are Computers?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We use computers every day, and depending on your job, you may spend most of your day on a computer. We carry around small computers in our pockets even! But we typically take computers and the way that they work for granted. What exactly is going on inside those smartphones, laptops, and desktops? How does an iPhone know what to do when I move my finger from right to left across the screen? How is a search engine able to guess what I'm typing so quickly?

We can't answer these questions in detail right now, but we can provide a perspective on what computers are capable of, and how they do some of the complex things that they do.
