You now have a conceptual picture of what code is, and some ideas about what it might be able to do. If not, consider the example of Facebook, or of a text editor (such as the one being used to write this very sentence). These are examples of **programs**, or a body of code that carries out a related set of tasks. The text editor can spellcheck and save files to the computer's disk, both tasks related to editing a file. Facebook can show you recent posts by your friends or remind you of a family member's birthday, both tasks related to social networking.

Each computer program is made up of smaller conceptual units called **algorithms**. An algorithm is a set of instructions to carry out a specific task. A text editor is a program, while spellchecking is an algorithm.

.. admonition:: Exercise

    On a piece of paper, or in a text file on your computer, write a list of steps that you might use to check the spelling of a single word. Assume you have only a dictionary at your disposal (i.e. you can't rely on the Internet or a spellchecking program to do the hard work for you).

Algorithms are recipes. They are lists of instructions to carry out a specific task. In this sense, there is nothing about the concept of an algorithm that is specific to computer programming. Your English-language instructions on how to check the spelling of a word are as much of an algorithm as the code used by a computer to carry out the same task. The difference is context: Your instructions are only suitable for another human, and likely carry some basic assumptions about how those instructions will be understood.

For example, your instructions may have included the instruction, "Take the first letter of the word." But which letter is the "first"? You're likely assumed that the person reading your instructions understands that English is read left-to-right. Such implicit assumptions are all around us when communicating with others, but when we communicate with computers -- by giving instructions via code -- we must be very explicit.

Here's a fun example illustrating how human language as we use it is loaded with ambiguities that a computer can not handle.

The key reminder here is that *computers are dumb*, or to put it more kindly, *computers will only do precisely what we tell them to do*, nothing less and nothing more. Our brains make thousands of inferences based on context every single day. When breaking down the bits of a problem in order to solve it via code, we'll be forced to confront every single such inference head-on.

Here's another demonstration of what makes up an algorithm from Harvard professor David Malan. This approach is a bit more formal than the discussion we've been having so far, but it will help bridge the gap between thinking of algorithms as lists of human-readable steps and code.
