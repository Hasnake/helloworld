What is code?
:::::::::::::

As we learned in the last section, computers are dumb. They are only capable of doing precisely what we tell them to do, and if our instructions are even the slightest bit off, they are unable decipher context and adjust accordingly.

The way in which we give computers instructions is via code. To write code, you must first choose a programming language. There are literally hundreds of programming languages to choose from. Here are a few examples of the Hello, World! program that we saw earlier.

We didn't specify this before, but in our first program, we chose to use the programming language Python, which we'll be using for the duration of this course. Here it is again:

.. code-block:: python

    print("Hello, World!")

And here is the same program in a few other common languages:

**PHP**

.. code-block:: php

    <?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?>

**C++**

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    }

**Java**

.. code-block:: java

    public class Hello {
    	public static void main(String []args) {
    		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    	}
    }

**JavaScript**

.. code-block:: js

    console.log("Hello, World!");
